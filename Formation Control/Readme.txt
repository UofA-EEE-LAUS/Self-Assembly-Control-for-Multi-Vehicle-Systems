  The Formation Control of this project is using visual leader-follower method to solve the problem. 
  The Stucture of the formation control system is shown as flow chart.
  The function apfpath.m gives a basic concept of how to generating a collision-free path within n direction.
  The main fuction of line formation is main_line.m and the main function of triangle formation is mian_tri.m,
before using these two function, run pathresult.mat first to get the stored collision-free path for the V-REP scene
scene_three_rover_finaltest_camera.ttt, the main function is used for moving the multi-vehicles system in the V-REP
scene.

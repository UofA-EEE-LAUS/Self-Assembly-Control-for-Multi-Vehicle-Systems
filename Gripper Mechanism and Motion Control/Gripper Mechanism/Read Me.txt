scene_single_rover with bump.ttt, scene_three_rover_with_bump.ttt and scene_two_rover with bump.ttt are the three scenes of the rovers cross the bummp.

Use the matlab file input the desitination of the three rovers let them finish the line formation. then input the 1 to let the gripper close. Then input the final destination of the three rovers and cross the bump.

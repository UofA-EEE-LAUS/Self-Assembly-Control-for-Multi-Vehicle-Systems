 Run scene_single_rover test_add_acceleration.ttt and pidtest, to recorde the acceleration and spped of the rover. Rover add 5% acceleration each loop.

The save the data from the pidtest, use the data to run the pidplot, get the image of the speed and acceleration to read the max acceleration.

scene_single_rover test_limite_acceleration.ttt have add the threshold max acceleration of the rover. This method fix the rover cannot suit in any situation issue.
